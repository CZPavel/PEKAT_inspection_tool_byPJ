# Next Steps / Follow-up Notes

This file tracks planned follow-up work after v3.4 implementation.

## Priority follow-up

1. User acceptance test of current v3.4
   - Run full real workflow with PEKAT project
   - Validate Script Catalog UX and pyzbar installer wizard behavior
   - Collect user feedback on layout and wording

2. Script description cleanup
   - Review auto-generated short descriptions in catalog
   - Normalize categories/tags
   - Improve human-readable summaries for each script

## Future idea

3. "Sound camera" feature concept
   - Prepare requirement draft for sound-camera integration
   - Define expected input/output and possible PEKAT data flow link
   - Evaluate whether this belongs to new tab or extension of Pekat Tuning
